# Tuesday, September 28, 2021
This is a daily note for Tuesday. Now if I can get it over to Github, ordinary people should be able to see it on the web. 

I should link to [[wombat]] or [[animals]].

I tried to make wikilinks and I don't think they are working in the github version!  However, if I ctrl-click on them in VSCode, they seem to work in VSCode!
