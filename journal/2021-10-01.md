I managed to spend a great deal of time on [[gaslamp fantasy]] today. Certainly the Foglios' "Girl Genius" is amazingly entertaining. One can easily spend many hours on it. I am a little disappointed that it is difficult to engage in collaborative story-telling -- but I am not surprised. Everything I have seen in the past has led me to conclude that collaborative story-telling is a difficult challenge.
