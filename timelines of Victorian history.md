TIMELINE OF REAL WORLD
SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES
Although many of the people mentioned in the history of
the Empire of Steam are real, the actual timing of events has
been altered in some cases to take into account the presence of
Babbage’s analytical engines. Just as modern computers have
allowed technology to advance at an accelerated pace in our
world, their pseudo-historical counterparts have enabled such
leaps in their world. Entries in italics are events that happened
much earlier in the Empire of Steam, or didn’t happen at all.

TIMELINE OF REAL WORLD
ALTERCATIONS
This is by no means an exhaustive list of the political
events and wars that took place during the period mentioned;
that would require an entire book of its own. Needless to say,
the British were pretty much involved in a dust-up somewhere
in the world for well over 100 years. Should you require fur-
ther details, it is recommended that you peruse the forums on
www.victorianwars.com.
