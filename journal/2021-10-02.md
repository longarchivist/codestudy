I have a great many links, and I would like to believe that a wiki could serve to organize some of these links.

I suppose I could try to make pages for categories.

[[Uebersax on Plato]]

[[shell scripting]]

[[Yahweh]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[Uebersax on Plato]: ../Uebersax on Plato.md "Uebersax on Plato"
[shell scripting]: ../shell scripting.md "shell scripting"
[Yahweh]: ../Yahweh.md "Yahweh"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
