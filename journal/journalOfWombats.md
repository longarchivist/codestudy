#Journal Entry Regarding Wombats

I have a certain interest in wombats, and I use WOMBAT as an acronym.
Customarily, just as other programmers use "foo" and "bar," I use "wombat" as a metasyntactic variable.
 
A "[[wombat]]" page should probably link to an [[animals]] page. I wonder whether a wikilink to [[llamas]] will work as expected.
