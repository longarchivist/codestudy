# My Big Idea

Okay, I tried the behavior shown alt

https://egghead.io/lessons/vs-code-create-a-second-brain-in-vscode-with-foam

and it looks like the correct kind of thing happened -- that is a page was automatically created.  However, the backlink does not appear to be working. 

So I will try to manually create a backlink here:
[[Tuesday, September 28, 2021]]

and I might as well try linking to other silly stuff like

[[animals]]

[[llamas]]




[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[animals]: journal/animals.md "animals"
[llamas]: journal/llamas.md "llamas"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
