I think I ought to institute a special type of journal review called [[Weekly Graph Review]] but it might be cluttered fast.

I probably should use tags to organize things.

I had a lot of thoughts about "small world networks" or "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" today.

I looked at a booksellers' category system that had more than 4000 categories arranged in about 200 top-level folders. That did not seem tractable. A hub node in a small-world network might have a hell of a lot of links. However, if one considers familiar patterns, the numbers are a little smaller. For example, a week has seven days. If I manage to keep a regular journal, I could have a node for each week. However, such links probably would not make for interesting wiki walks.

This kind of automatic wiki system might be very useful if I could use it as an actual ZettelKasten.
