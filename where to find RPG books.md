# where to find RPG books

 some obscure IRC server, so you need mIRC or something like that, then connect to /server

irc.enerla.net

, then join the channel #rpgbookz, then use the command @find to search for anything you want, it has more depth than the trove, been using it for 20 years I think, but of course the trove was the easy way.
